# Spelunky tools
Spelunky 2 tools for item spawning and exploration. Most of this awesome stuff is not made by me, I just compiled it here.

## Installation
  - Extract somewhere
    - (Optional) Extract the game assets with https://github.com/spelunky-fyi/modlunky2/ and run the scripts from `Spelunky 2/Mods/Extracted/Data` to show textures in gui
  - Run scripts after the game is running
