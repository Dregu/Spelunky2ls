# Experimental rust injector and node cli
It's lightning fast, you can use it over ssh, but it has some other issues. Once again I just made the cli, injector by iojonmbnmb.

   557: ENT_TYPE_ITEM_JETPACK_MECH
   558: ENT_TYPE_ITEM_PURCHASABLE_JETPACK
   646: ENT_TYPE_FX_JETPACKFLAME

```
## Usage
Get https://rustup.rs/ and https://nodejs.org/en/. Start the game, go to camp and run:
```
cargo build
node cli
```
## TODO
You can't exit the game, too bad!
